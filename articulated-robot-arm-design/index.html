<p>To optimize the mechanism design of the Raven IV sys-tem we conﬁgure the link architecture of each robotic arm. Articulated robots are defined as robots containing rotary joints. There are 5 joints and therefore 5 axes. The basic three rotary movements are base. The arm has been 3D printed and there has been made a custom part which is a big and heavy round base on which the arm is located. These joints are commonly referred to as axes in the robotic world.

<p>Most industrial robots have four to six axes with six axes being the most common. This chain of revolute joints provides greater freedom and dexterity in movement of the articulated robotic arm. These robots are typically driven by servo motors and can be as essential as a two-axis configuration or as complex as ten or more axes. Rotary joints allow a full range of motion as they rotate through multiple planes and they increase. This paper features the kinematic modelling of a 5-axis stationary articulated robot arm which is used for doing successful robotic manipulation task in its workspace and incorporates the obstacle avoiding algorithms also during the pick and place operation. Articulated robots are defined as robots containing rotary joints.

<p>The manipulator design is mostly expected to pick up cubes and the geometric shapes like a box. If the volumes of robots are the same the robot with 3 rotating axes or the highest degree of. The number of axes represents the number of directions that a robot can move individually. This robot is able to grasp. Instead of designing a new robot arm this study tries to optimize existing arms belong to known brands. The thesis involved a detailed study of mechanical design fabrication kinematic control and.
