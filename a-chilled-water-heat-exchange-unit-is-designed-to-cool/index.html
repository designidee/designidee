<p>The chilled water circulates through a chilled water loop and through coils located in air handlers. The water brings the heat back to the chiller where the compression cycle cools the water before it is returned to the heat process. Chilled water system is designed with versatility in system coupling where there is no limitation in the number of fan coil unit coupling with mini chiller as long as they meet the designed capacity requirament water ﬂow rate. It returns to the evaporator where the refrigerant absorbs the unwanted heat and directs it to the condenser. Chilled water cooling is not very different from typical residential air conditioning where water is pumped from the chiller to the air handler unit to cool the air.</p>
