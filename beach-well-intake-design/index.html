<p>Beach wells are recommended when seawater quality can vary over the season andor when high turbidity peaks can occur. Mobile Surface water Open Intake. A vertical seawater intake well consists of a non-metallic casing typically fiberglass or reinforced pipe a well screen and a stainless steel submersible or vertical turbine pump. Beach Well Intake Beach well intake means that seawater out from intake well constructed as close to the coastline as possible is filtered by seabed as the water source of desalination plant. Other types of well intake systems include slant wells horizontal wells and radial collector wells Ranney wells.</p>

An intake should be designed and constructed on the basis of the following points. Intake Designs for the Proposed Poseidon Water Desalination Facility at Huntington Beach California Authored by the Independent Scientific Technical Advisory Panel Under the Auspices of the California Coastal Commission and Poseidon Resources Surfside LLC Convened and Facilitated by CONCUR Inc. These intake facilities are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sandseabed formations in the area of source water extraction. The intake chamber may be constructed inside the canal bank if it does not offer any appreciable resistance to normal flow in the canal.</p>

A vertical well as the name implies is a well-drilled straight down into the underlying rock or unconsolidated coastal aquifer system. This capacity of 16000 m 3 per km 2 might be useful for a medium-size reverse osmosis plant like the MED plant currently operating in Dukhan Township and they can be used to artificially recharging the aquifer. These intake facilities are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sandseabed formations in the area of source water extraction.
