Over the years the absorption solution has become preferable by many than an electric chiller. In air-conditioning strategy of decoupling cooling and ventilation tasks has stimulated considerable interest in radiant cooling systems with dedicated outdoor air system DOAS. The absorption process is exothermic ie it generates heat and heat must be rejected from the absorber to the condenser water and cooling tower loop. The absorption chiller modeling is then exploited in a computer tool that gives valuable information on the planning of solar cooling systems.
