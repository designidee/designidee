<p>The large filtration area of the VPLDE fil - ter unit makes it possible to succesfully filter fluids with a high dirt load even at a high flow rate. Under 075 MGD 28 MLD they are typically more economical than horizontal pressure filters. LEEM offers you the widest choice of pressure leaf filter configurations with leaf areas ranging from 30 to 2000 square feet. The test is relatively simple to carry out so a number of variables can be studied and optimized. The rigid filter leaves have five layers of stainless steel wire screen.</p>
