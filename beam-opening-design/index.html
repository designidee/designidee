<p>Therefore analysis and design of a beam with small openings may follow the similar course of action as that of a solid beam. The openings that are circular square or nearly square in. Design of rectangular reinforced concrete beam procedure. Even though large number of transverse openings with various shapes and sizes might employ but it is better to use circular shape to make rooms for service pipes for example electrical supply and plumping and using rectangular transverse opening through for. Firstly begin the design by selecting depth and width of the beam then compute reinforcement area. This study examines the adequacy of the ACI Code approach modified for the inclusion of transverse openings for shear design of a beam with circular openings.
