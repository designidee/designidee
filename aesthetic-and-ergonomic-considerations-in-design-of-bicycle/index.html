<p>The ergonomic analysis and aesthetic evaluation should be performed on the CAD model with more precise geometry definition. Widespread use of bicycles necessitates the design should match the anthropometric data to be ergonomic. However increasingly the boundaries between the two disciplines are disappearing and ergonomists are taking some responsibility for the aesthetics of the design using scientific methods to increase understanding of the aesthetics both pleasurable and displeasurable and applying this to the design of products. It is important to include ergonomics considerations throughout the design process and ideally from the very start. Aesthetic and ergonomic design cycle using intelligent.
