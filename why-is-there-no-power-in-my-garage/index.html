<p>I changed all the outlets to gfci and checked again. It is not recommended to use a switch to power the garage door opener onoff as repetitive power cycling may damage the operators receiver logic board. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. Its also possible that the supply to the garage has been run from one of the houses sockets circuits via a Fused Connection Unit FCU aka fused switch somewhere - if that were he case the fuse may have blown or it might even have got switched off. Theres no crime in finding out the working in your house its just that electricity is a killer no matter how simple it may seem thats why when we work on an installation we have to put our name on a piece of paper that says we accept responsibility if it goes wrong also if we give you advice other than call someone in thats competent and something goes wrong and you electricute yourself or the place. Living in Florida the chances of losing power at least once during hurricane season is very likely.

<p>If you are experiencing lost power in a garage there may be a tripped a GFI outlet. Anyway once you rule out the GFCI and the circuit breaker you then check for power at the receptacles. No power to garage. The service panel is located in the house. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. Surge protection is the key way to prevent this from happening. My Garage With The Bmw E36 M3 Right At Home Cool Garages Garage Bmw E36.</p>

<p>Living in Florida the chances of losing power at least once during hurricane season is very likely. Surge protection is the key way to prevent this from happening. So you shut off your main panels main breaker and your garage didnt trip. No power in garage. Should be 110 to 120 volts from the breaker leg to the neutral ground if its a single pole breaker or 220 to 240 volts across the two breaker legs if its a two pole. Went back and tested again at the main garage board it has dropped to 210v also the same readings down the line till the garage.
