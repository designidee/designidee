<p>The garage door opener will beep when operating on battery backup power or when you can no longer charge the battery. Im not going to tell you to try and utilize a battery charger to fix the issue as MoveMoreCommentsLinkToTop has suggested in the comments but it has been my experience when a battery has sat for an extended period of time with a constant power draw on it the lead plates get sulfide crystallized over and will no longer take a charge. Open the remote by sliding the battery cover open. More often than not garage doors stall because its batteries are weak. If there is a power outage or problem with the charger the battery will start to run down. The gate or garage door this will give you are more accurate diagnoses.
