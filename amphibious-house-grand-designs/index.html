<p>It is a 220 ton amphibious house. Introducing Britains first amphibious house which cannot flood because it rises along with the water. They had to dig to 5 metres to make the footings due to it being on a riverbank. The house is amphibious in that for much of its life its sits on the ground in the normal way but if there is flooding it is able to gently rise with the floodwater settling back again when the floodwater recedes. Instead of trying to beat back rising water levels these innovative structures work with them adapting from land-based to floating houses with the ease of an amphibian. An amphibious house is a building that rests on the ground on fixed foundations but whenever a flood occurs the entire building rises up in its dock and floats there buoyed by the floodwater.
