<p>Generative Design This is the second in a seven-part series exploring how the principles of design for additive manufacturing DfAM can help unlock the many benefits made possible with metal 3D printing. Live Parts is an experimental technology that applies morphogenetic principles and advanced simulation to auto-generate part designs in minutes. Most generative design programs dont consider how the part will be manufactured so engineers must still use design for additive manufacturing DFAM principles to help create a better part that would reduce or eliminate the need for supports a process that requires a detailed understanding of the manufacturing process. As you may know generative design is part of the family of Design for Additive Manufacturing DfAM techniques. MSC Apex Generative Design technology is here to make the design and development for AM smarter and more sustainable.</p>

Also I want to share a big thanks to an awesome team of experts who have been developing and validating this solution and to Ben Weiss Adam Day Matt Oosthuizen and Divy Kishor Tiwary for helping me author this. 11 Generative Design within the Design for Additive Manufacturing approach Nowadays it is generally accepted that in Aerospace and Industrial applications we can achieve the main advantages from the introduction of advanced design procedures if we combine them with Additive Manufacturing AM processes and techniques. However it would be misleading to state that generative design is limited to only additive manufacturing although in many cases the technology will be the most optimal production method. While this isnt the first instance of generative design or of additive manufacturing being used in machine parts it is one of the first times they have been used in a high-end consumer product.

<p>AM technology enables better parts if the designer can take advantage of its abilities at this stage. In this course we explore the basics of geometry creation and the mindset shift needed to build a generative designa deeper understanding of generative design its parameters and how to work with the results. However it would be misleading to state that generative design is limited to only additive manufacturing although in many cases the technology will be the most optimal production method. Read an overview in our Figure 3. Live Parts is an experimental technology that applies morphogenetic principles and advanced simulation to auto-generate part designs in minutes. Both of these parts produced by generative design feature traditional CNC milling techniques.
