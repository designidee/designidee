<p>Antenna effect The Antenna Effect or Plasma Induced Gate Oxide Damage is an effect that can potentially cause yield and reliability problems during the manufacturing of MOS integrated circuits. A multigate device or multiple gate field-effect transistor MuGFET refers to a MOSFET metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor which incorporates more than one gate into a single device. Design for manufacturability also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM is the general engineering practice of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. Due to the high current flow in metal metal atoms it can move from its original place.

Maturi Detection of an Antenna Effect in VLSI Designs Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems pp. To avoid the antenna effect we need to avoid large Interconnect Area to Gate of a MOSFET or we can also use the diode placed near the MOSFET so that the diode will provide a conductive path to substrate if the induced charge is above a limit. Antenna performance is always a compromise or trade-off between numerous interacting elements all of which contribute to the end capabilities of the final design.

<p>Antenna effect The antenna effect plasma induced gate oxide damage is an effect that can potentially cause yield and reliability problems during the manufacture of MOS integrated circuits. Illustration of the cause of antenna effect. A multigate device or multiple gate field-effect transistor MuGFET refers to a MOSFET metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor which incorporates more than one gate into a single device. Circuit Speed high Power consumption low Design Area low 4. We are world leading antenna manufacturers to supply our clients with antennas that provide supreme performance while remaining cost effective. These DFM guidelines help to precisely define various tolerances rules and common manufacturing checks related to DFM. Pdf The Antenna Effect Problem And Solutions A đỗ Tấn Academia Edu.</p>

<p>When it happens in larger quantity the metal can open or swell of the metallic layer it can happen. We are world leading antenna manufacturers to supply our clients with antennas that provide supreme performance while remaining cost effective. A half-wave dipole antenna has a power gain of 164 or 215 dB over an isotropic source. The IC fabs normally supply antenna rules that must be obeyed to avoid this problem and violation of such rules is called an antenna violation. Proposed methodology can handle large size designs using standard design rule checking and circuit extraction procedures. We have described three different methods to fix the violations.
