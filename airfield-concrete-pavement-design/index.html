<h3 id="concrete-urc---pavement-quality-concrete-pqc---without-dowel-bars-tie-bars-or-keys-on-a-rolled-dry-lean-concrete-dlc-to-construct-airfield-runways-and-taxiways">Concrete URC - pavement quality concrete PQC - without dowel bars tie bars or keys on a rolled dry lean concrete DLC to construct airfield runways and taxiways.</h3><p>This manual is applicable to all field operating activities having mobilization construction responsibilities. Most concrete airfield pavement design procedures are based on developing sufficient slab thicknesses to resist fatigue cracking that is structural cracking caused by repeated load applications at stress levels less than the ultimate static strength of the concrete. All the transverse and longitudinal joints are provided with 30-mm-thick dowel bars. Design load is very High. After determining the design aircraft the FAA has identified a standard method to report pavement strength at an airport.</p>
