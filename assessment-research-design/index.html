<p><strong>Assessment Research Design</strong>, A research method is a strategy used to implement that plan. Different textbooks place different meanings on research design. As discussed above the design of an assessment system should be based on a carefully devised plan that considers the purpose of each of the system components and how they will serve to improve student learning.</p>

<p>The research design refers to the overall strategy that you choose to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. A traditionally favored type of research design that has influenced outcomes-based assessment methodology is quantitative assessment. As discussed above the design of an assessment system should be based on a carefully devised plan that considers the purpose of each of the system components and how they will serve to improve student learning. Research design and methods are different but closely related because good research design ensures that the data you obtain will help you answer your research question more effectively. Research designs in an evaluation and test different parts of the program logic with each one.</p>

A clear and stated intention to address and contribute to a societal problem the establishment of the research process and objectives in relation to the problem context and the continuous reflection on the usefulness of the research findings and. For instance a single-case A 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 withdrawal design aimed to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation using visuo-spatio-motor cueing for two participants with severe unilateral neglect after a severe right-hemisphere stroke.</p>
