<p>These cross-sectional advantages and disadvantages show us that a massive undertaking of simultaneous data collection can provide unique results that can benefit an entire population group. Advantages of using qualitative data analysis software include being freed from manual and clerical tasks saving time being able to deal with large amounts of qualitative data having increased flexibility and having improved validity and auditability of qualitative research. However this type of study is limited in its ability to draw valid conclusions about any association or possible causality because the presence of risk factors and outcomes are measured simultaneously.
