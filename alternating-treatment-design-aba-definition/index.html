<p>An experimental design in which two or more conditions one of which may be a non-treatment control condition are presented in rapidly alternating succession independent of the level of responding. It is one of the most important skills because we rely so heavily on data to guide our interventions. An experiment reintroducing the B condition enables the replication of treatment effects which strengthens the demonstration of experimental control. Differences in responding between or among conditions are attributed tot he effects of the conditions. Efficiently compares intervention effectiveness.</p>
